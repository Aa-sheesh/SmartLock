## Overview

SmartLock provides a decentralized solution for secure access control by integrating:
- **Blockchain Technology:** To ensure data immutability and transparency.
- **Advanced Cryptography:** To protect sensitive information.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces:** For seamless interaction between administrators and users.

This project is ideal for environments where security and data integrity are paramount, from corporate facilities to secure data centers.

## Features

- **Secure:** Uses industry-standard cryptographic techniques to safeguard access.
- **Immutable:** Blockchain-based smart contracts prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Transparent:** Every operation is recorded on a public ledger for auditability.
- **Scalable:** Designed to integrate with various infrastructures and scale as needed.
- **User-Friendly:** Built with modern web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS) for an intuitive experience.

## Architecture

SmartLock's core components include:

- **Frontend:** A React application styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend:** A Node.js/Express API that handles authentication, user management, and interacts with the blockchain.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used to store user data and system logs.
- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts manage lock states and provide an immutable ledger of access events.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication secures API endpoints and user sessions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** v14 or above
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB:** Local or cloud-based instance
- **Blockchain Environment:** (e.g., Ethereum test network or a local blockchain simulator)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartlock.git
   cd smartlock
   ```
2. **Backend Setup**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
4. **Configuration**

    Create a .env file in the backend directory with your configuration variables. For example:

    ```.env
        # backend/.env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
        PORT=5000
        BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_URL=your_blockchain_node_url
    ```
    Adjust any configuration needed for your environment. If your frontend requires environment variables, create a corresponding .env file in the frontend directory.

5. **Running the Application**
    1. **Start the Backend**:

        ```bash
            cd backend
            npm start
        ```
    2. **Start the Frontend**:

        ```bash
            cd ../frontend
            npm start
        ```
        Your application should now be running. By default, the frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
Once the application is running:

- Users can log in to access their personalized dashboard, view security alerts, and monitor security metrics.
- Admins have an extended dashboard to manage users, review system logs, and configure system settings.
